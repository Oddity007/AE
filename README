libAECore.a should appear in /usr/lib/
Headers for Core and SOIL should appear in /usr/include/AE

To use with gcc, just do -lAECore when you compile.
To use with Xcode, just add -lAECore to the C flags, or add it in as libAECore.a should appear in the Core/ directory.

To include the headers, do <AE/Core.h>
SOIL.h is at <AE/SOIL.h>

SOIL was made by Jonathan Dummer, under public domain.
AE was made by Oliver Daids, under WTFPL.

Currently only for Macosx (Universal), help for other OSes would be highly appreciated.
