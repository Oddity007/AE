A game engine with simple-to-use in mind.


SOIL was made by Jonathan Dummer, under public domain.
AE was made by Oliver Daids, under the WTFPL, with the added provision that this is provided as-is, so don't hold me or contributors liable for damages caused.



Currently only for MacOSX (Universal), help for other OSes would be highly appreciated.
